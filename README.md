# Full-Stack Application README

Overview
This document provides instructions and necessary information for setting up and launching the front-end client, back-end server, and database for the full-stack application. This guide also includes information on essential tools such as PostgreSQL.app, pgAdmin4, and Postman.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- PostgreSQL.app
- pgAdmin4
- Postman

## Setting Up the Database

- Open PostgreSQL.app and start the PostgreSQL server.
- Open pgAdmin4 and connect to the PostgreSQL server.
- Create a new database for the application.
- Run the SQL scripts provided in the database/ directory of the project to set up the schema and initial data.

## Launching the Back-End Server

- Navigate to the back-end directory in your terminal: cd path/to/backend
- Install the necessary dependencies: npm install
- Create a .env file in the root of the back-end directory, and populate it with the required environment variables (refer to the .env.example file).
- Start the server: npm start
- The server should now be running on http://localhost:5000 (or your specified port).

## Launching the Front-End Client

- Navigate to the front-end directory in your terminal: cd path/to/frontend
- Install the necessary dependencies: npm install
- Start the client: npm start
- The client should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000 (or your specified port).

## Using the Application

- Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the front-end application.
- Interact with the application as desired. Backend API requests will be directed to http://localhost:5000.

## Testing the API with Postman

- Open Postman.
- Import the provided Postman collection located in the postman/ directory of the project.
- Ensure the back-end server is running, then send requests to the API using Postman to test and interact with the back-end services.

## Additional Information

- Frontend technologies used: React.js, Redux, Tailwind CSS, etc.
- Backend technologies used: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, etc.
- For more details on API endpoints and responses, refer to the API documentation available in the docs/ directory.

## Troubleshooting & Support

For any issues or support, please check the FAQ section in the documentation or file an issue in the project's repository.

# Project Instruction

Certainly! Here's a recap of the project overview and the steps involved in creating your full-stack application, incorporating React with TypeScript for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, and using both RESTful APIs and GraphQL for communication:
  Project Overview

- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js (Express.js framework recommended for simplicity)
- APIs: Both RESTful and GraphQL
- Authentication & Authorization: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Database: PostgreSQL, with schema design and relations
- Tools: pgAdmin for database management

## Step 1: Setup Your Development Environment

- Ensure Node.js, PostgreSQL, and pgAdmin are installed on your machine.
- Initialize a new Node.js project: npm init in your project directory.
- Install React with TypeScript for the frontend: npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript.
- Set up a new Express.js project in a separate directory or within your project structure for the backend.

## Step 2: Design Your Database Schema

- Plan your database schema. For a user system, you'll need at least a Users table. Consider adding a Posts table for more complexity.
- Use pgAdmin to create your database and tables.
- Example Users table columns: id, username, email, passwordHash.
- Example Posts table columns: id, userId, title, content, createdAt.

## Step 3: Implement Backend Logic

- Set up Express.js: Initialize your Express application.
- Database Connection: Use node-postgres (pg) for PostgreSQL integration.
  - Authentication & Authorization:
  - Implement user registration and login endpoints. Store hashed passwords (use bcrypt).
  - Use JWT for managing user sessions. Implement middleware to protect routes that require authentication.
- CRUD Operations: Implement endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts.
- Input Validation & Sanitization: Use libraries like express-validator to validate and sanitize input data.
- GraphQL Setup: Use apollo-server-express to add a GraphQL layer. Define your schema and resolvers, including queries and mutations for user operations and posts.

## Step 4: Frontend Development with React and TypeScript

- Component Structure: Design your component hierarchy. At minimum, you'll need components for Signup, Login, PostList, and PostForm.
- State Management: Use React Context or Redux for state management, especially for user authentication status.
  - API Integration:
  - For REST: Use Axios or Fetch API to communicate with your Express backend.
  - For GraphQL: Use Apollo Client to interact with your GraphQL API.
- Forms and Validation: Implement forms for signing up, logging in, and CRUD operations on posts. Ensure client-side validation.

## Step 5: Authentication Flow

- Implement the login flow in your frontend, storing the JWT token received from the backend and attaching it to subsequent requests that require authentication.
- Implement a way to check if the user is logged in (e.g., checking the presence of the JWT token) and redirect or enable certain UI elements accordingly.

## Step 6: Testing

- Backend: Write tests for your API endpoints using tools like Jest and Supertest.
- Frontend: Test your React components with Jest and React Testing Library.

## Step 7: Running Your Application

- Start your PostgreSQL database.
- Run the backend with node or nodemon.
- Start your React application with npm start.
- Use pgAdmin to manage and inspect your database as needed.
  Note
  This project involves numerous detailed steps, especially in coding the backend logic, setting up GraphQL alongside REST, and ensuring secure authentication practices. It's crucial to break down each part into manageable tasks and focus on getting each part working incrementally.
  Feel free to ask for specific guidance on any of these steps as you progress through your project. Whether it's setting up your Express.js server, designing your React components, or implementing authentication with JWT, I'm here to help you through the process.
